Hello Agawam Public Schools, and welcome back from a deserved winter break. The Technology Department has been hard at work making improvements to the district. Here are a few of the things that have changed.

## Monthly Announcements
The Technology Department will be posting monthly announcements for all staff to update everyone on changes to technology in the district. Not all the announcements will affect you directly, but it is good for everyone to know what is going on. Technology has a large role in our day to day responsibilities. 

These announcements will be posted on the new technology website (see below) for everyone to see and sent to the district via email. If you ever have a question or concern about anything in the announcements, just submit a support ticket. 

## New Website
We have built a new website for the Technology Department (https://tech.agawamed.org). This will start small and grow over time. The goal is to have a central place for everyone in the Agawam Public Schools Community to go for support and questions about technology. 

The website will be where you go to submit a support ticket, view any technology announcements or updates, and find helpful articles. 

Please take a look at the site, and let us know if you have any feedback or think anything should be added. 

## New Ticketing System
Over the winter break, we began the transition to a new support ticketing system. We are moving from Spiceworks to Jira Service Desk. The change will be mostly internal to the department. Allowing us to process and respond to tickets faster and in a more organized way. 

But, there are a few changes that affect everyone. 

- Whenever you submit a support ticket, you will receive an automated response email letting you know it was received. 
- The forms to submit a ticket has changed slightly (many of you of already notices the new look). The form now runs through a Jira Web Form, not a Google Form. 
- Staff can still email support@agawamed.org to submit a ticket. 
- You can also submit a ticket on the new [Technology Department website](https://tech.agawamed.org).

There will be a few more changes coming in the summer as we try to improve and expand the technology support system. Any ideas or feedback is greatly appreciated. 


## How To Email IT
One last quick note. If you are trying to email the Technology Department, please use the support@agawamed.org email address. An email sent to this address will go to everyone in the department. 

Some users are mistakenly sending emails to ITStaff@agawamed.org. This is just a distribution address that is not monitored. 

That is all for now. The Technology Department will be sending out more announcements at least once a month. Always be sure to check the [website](https://tech.agawamed.org) for the latest information. 

If you have any questions or concerns about anything in this announcement, please submit a support ticket.Â

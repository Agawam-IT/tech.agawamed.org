The Technology Department with help from the Curriculum Department is taking a look at all classroom software and hardware usages and needs to inform our future planning. We are asking all staff in the district to participate in this brief survey. 

Please follow the link below. You will need to be logged into your @agawamed.org account and you will only be able to submit the survey once.

Welcome to your new role in the Agawam Public Schools!  Here are a few quick things to think about as you first start to utilize technology resources here at the Agawam Public Schools.

### Initial Setup Steps

The first step in getting up and running on the Agawam Public Schools network is to log in to a **Microsoft Windows based device**, such as a desktop or laptop.  Each school's media center would be a great place to perform this initial login as there are many Microsoft Windows devices in the media centers.

- **Username and temporary password** - As a new hire, your username and a temporary password will be provided to you in writing by your building administration once the IT Department has set up your account.  For most users, your username would be your first initial follwed by your last name.  **(Jane Doe for example would be JDoe)**.  In the event of duplicate usernames you may have a number added.  **(John Doe might be JDoe2 for example as Jane Doe already has JDoe)**.  The temporary password provided is only good for the initial login of a new account - the system will immediately prompt you to set a new password.

- **Set a strong password** - When you set your NEW PASSWORD, the system requires a minimum of 8 characters with at least ONE capital letter, ONE lowercase letter, ONE number and ONE symbol (such as exclamation point, question mark, ampersand, etc).  This password is yours for the next 180 days, at which time the system will prompt you to change your password.

### Let's Get Productive - Meet agawamed.org our G-Suite for Education Domain

The Agawam Public Schools utilizes **Google's G-Suite for Education** for **electronic mail** and **productivity applications** such as Google Docs, Sheets, SLides and Forms.  By setting up your network account, you will have also begun the process of setting up your G-Suite environment.

If you are familiar with Google's GMAIL, then you are going to feel quite comfortable with G-Suite for Education.  Unlike a personal gmail account, which typically is username@gmail.com, each school system is allowed to have their own G-Suite domain.  **As an employee of the Agawam Public Schools, your G-Suite account will be your username@agawamed.org.**

**Accessing G-Suite for Education** - In order to access your "agawamed.org" account, you simply need to point your web browser (preferably Google Chrome) at http://www.google.com and click **Sign In**.

Log in with yourusername@agawamed.org and the password you just set.  **(Replace yourusername with your info - in our example above Jane Doe would be jdoe@agawamed.org)**.  You will be asked to accept a usage agreement and then will proceed to your inbox.
 - **Set an email signature** - While you are in your email for the first time, it is a good idea to set up an email signature to let recipients know who you are - itâ€™s an easy thing to forget to do.  Click Set an EMail Signature for more information.

Welcome to your new role in the Agawam Public Schools!  Here are a few quick things to think about as you first start to utilize technology resources here at the Agawam Public Schools.

### Initial Setup Steps

The first step in getting up and running on the Agawam Public Schools network is to log in to a **Microsoft Windows based device**, such as a desktop or laptop.  Each school's media center would be a great place to perform this initial login as there are many Microsoft Windows devices in the media centers.

- **Username and temporary password** - As a new hire, your username and a temporary password will be provided to you in writing by your building administration once the IT Department has set up your account.  For most users, your username would be your first initial follwed by your last name.  **(Jane Doe for example would be JDoe)**.  In the event of duplicate usernames you may have a number added.  **(John Doe might be JDoe2 for example as Jane Doe already has JDoe)**.  The temporary password provided is only good for the initial login of a new account - the system will immediately prompt you to set a new password.

- **Set a strong password** - When you set your NEW PASSWORD, the system requires a minimum of 8 characters with at least ONE capital letter, ONE lowercase letter, ONE number and ONE symbol (such as exclamation point, question mark, ampersand, etc).  This password is yours for the next 180 days, at which time the system will prompt you to change your password.

### Let's Get Productive - Meet agawamed.org our G-Suite for Education Domain

The Agawam Public Schools utilizes **Google's G-Suite for Education** for **electronic mail** and **productivity applications** such as Google Docs, Sheets, SLides and Forms.  By setting up your network account, you will have also begun the process of setting up your G-Suite environment.

If you are familiar with Google's GMAIL, then you are going to feel quite comfortable with G-Suite for Education.  Unlike a personal gmail account, which typically is username@gmail.com, each school system is allowed to have their own G-Suite domain.  **As an employee of the Agawam Public Schools, your G-Suite account will be your username@agawamed.org.**

- **Accessing G-Suite for Education** - In order to access your "agawamed.org" account, you simply need to point your web browser (preferably Google Chrome) at http://www.google.com and click **Sign In**.

Log in with yourusername@agawamed.org and the password you just set.  **(Replace yourusername with your info - in our example above Jane Doe would be jdoe@agawamed.org)**.  You will be asked to accept a usage agreement and then will proceed to your inbox.
 - **Set an email signature** - While you are in your email for the first time, it is a good idea to set up an email signature to let recipients know who you are - itâ€™s an easy thing to forget to do.
 
- **Meet the Content Filter** - As a public school, we are bound by CIPPA regulations when it comes to accessing content on the internet. In order to comply, the district utilizes a **Barracuda Content Filter** for all APS accounts.  Windows devices authenticate automatically, but if you are using an iPad or Chromebook, you will need to authenticate to Barracuda once a day with your APS Username and Password (not your e-mail address).  A great website to use for this is http://www.espn.com as it is blocked to unauthenticated users.

### FOB, FAB, PROXIMITY TAG - What is this "Chip" on the back of my ID?

All staff members are given an Agawam Public Schools ID badge as well as a black _chip_ affixed to the back of your ID, which acts as your building key card and your copier card.  They are often refered to as many different things by district staff, the correct name is a "Proximity Tag". 

**Door Entry** - to enter the building you work in, simply hold your chip "in proximity" of the door sensor and you will be identified to the system.

**Copier/Printer Usage** - This same proximity tag identifies you at copiers district wide.  In order to make photocopies, simply hold your chip "in proximity" of the door sensor and you will granted access to the copier.  If you are printing documents from your workstation, you can print your document to the copiers by simply selecting the "Follow-Me" printer.  Once _printed_ to "Follow-Me" simply pull up your print jobs at the copier and release them.

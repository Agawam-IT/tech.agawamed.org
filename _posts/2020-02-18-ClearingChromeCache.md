Another article in a recurring series of _common problems_ we see in the IT Department.

### Symptoms

Websites seem to load incorrectly - often only on specific sites that once worked correctly.

### Possible Cause
When you use a browser, like Chrome, it saves some information from websites in its cache and cookies. Clearing them fixes certain problems, like loading or formatting issues on sites.

### Possible Resolution - Clearing Your Broser Cache in Chrome

- On your computer, open Chrome.
- At the top right, click the **three vertical dots**.
- Click **More tools** and then **Clear browsing data**.
- At the top, choose a time range. **To delete everything, select All time**.
- Next to "Cookies and other site data" and "Cached images and files," check the boxes.
- Click **Clear Data**.

Now try closing out Chrome and reloading the affected website.  This has been known to fix formatting issues on various websites, especially some of our e-textbook sites.

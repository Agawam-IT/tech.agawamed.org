### Overview

All staff members are issued an Agawam Public Schools ID and a **proximity tag** which acts as their _building key_ and _copier access card_.

### Door Access Information

The **proximity tag** is a black circular disk ("chip") that is assigned to the user.  This **proximity tag** identifies the user as a staff member and grants them the ability to access their assigned building(s) according to a user based schedule.  Different user groups are allowed different access times base dupon their role.

### If You Lose Your Proximity Tag

If you lose your proximity tag, **it is your responsibility to immediately notify the IT Department via a helpdesk ticket** so that we may disable the tag until it is found or replaced.  

Please remember, this tag is essentially your door key to the building - if it is disabled quickly nobody can try to enter the building under your name.

If you want to work on Google Drive  files from your desktop, use **Drive File Stream**. Your files live in the cloud and you access them on demand. This frees up space on your computer’s hard drive, saves network bandwidth, and means less time waiting for files to sync. You can also make files in Google Drive available offline, and they’ll sync to the cloud when you’re back online.
 
You access My Drive from My Computer (Microsoft® Windows®) or Finder (Apple® Mac®) like any regular folder. You can then move your files to Drive, where it will sync to the cloud and free up your computer space.

If you want to work on Google Drive  files from your desktop, use **Drive File Stream**. Your files live in the cloud and you access them on demand. This frees up space on your computer’s hard drive, saves network bandwidth, and means less time waiting for files to sync. You can also make files in Google Drive available offline, and they’ll sync to the cloud when you’re back online.
 
You access My Drive from My Computer (Microsoft® Windows®) or Finder (Apple® Mac®) like any regular folder. You can then move your files to Drive, where it will sync to the cloud and free up your computer space.

### Accessing Drive File Stream

All district Windows Pc’s and Laptops have **Drive File Stream** already installed.
- You'll see the **Drive File Stream** icon at the bottom right on Windows or at the top right on Mac.
- Click the **Drive File Stream** icon.
  - If this is your first time using **Drive File Stream**, you will be asked to log in to your agawamed.org account.
- To access your Google Drive files and folders, click **Open Drive Folder** .
When **Drive File Stream** is run, it creates a drive in My Computer or a device in Finder named **Google Drive File Stream**. All your Google Drive files appear here.  A quick way to access this on a Windows PC is to use the keyboard combination **WINDOWS + E** to open file explorer.

### Moving Files to a Folder

- Decide which files you want to store in Drive.
  - (Optional) Organize the files in folders the way you want them to appear in Drive.
- Click Drive File Stream .
- Click Open Drive Folder .
- Move the files and folders into a folder. From now on, these files exist in the Drive folder and are synchronized with other devices that also have Drive installed.

If your internet connection breaks or you need to go offline in the middle of a sync, Drive File Stream picks up where it left off when you’re back online.
Pause syncing:

- Click Drive File Stream .
- Click More  (the three dots) > Pause Syncing.

When paused, Drive File Stream won't upload local changes to Drive, and new versions of files made available offline won't be downloaded. Click Resume Syncing to start sync back up.

### Symptoms

The chromebook does not seem to be "behaving" correctly.

### Possible Cause

With regular use, Chromebooks require very little maintenance.  However, if a device has been offline for an extended period of time (either physically powered off or disconnected from the network) it may no longer autoupdate and behave erratically. 

Thankfully, if this is the case, solving the problem is often as simple as running a manual ChromeOS update.

### Possible Resolution - Running a Manual ChromeOS Update

Any agawamed.org user can do this!

- Log in to the chromebook
- Open the Chrome web browser
- Type in **chrome://help** in the address bar.
- Click **Check for Updates**

You can continue to work as the update downloads in the background.  Simply be sure to **shut down** the chromebook when you are done working and the update will install the next time you boot up your chromebook!

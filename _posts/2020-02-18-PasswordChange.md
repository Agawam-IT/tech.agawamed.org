Another article in a recurring series of _common problems_ we see in the IT Department.

### Symptoms

User has received a notification that their password will expire in the next **XX** days.

### Cause

All staff member passwords have a **180 day shelf life** before they must be changed.  This is done to promote network security.

### Resolution

- Log into Windows Device with existing password if you haven't already done so.
- While logged in, press **CTRL-ALT-DEL** and select **CHANGE A PASSWORD**
- Enter a new password that meets the following requirements
  - must be at least 8 characters in length, contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one symbol (EX: Exclamation point, Ampersand, etc.)
  - Cannot contain reserved words (ex: Your name, the word “password”, etc.)
  - May not be one of your five most recently used passwords.

Once changed, your new password should also synchronize to your agawamed.org account.

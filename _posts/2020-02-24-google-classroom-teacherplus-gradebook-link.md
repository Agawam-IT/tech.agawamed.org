You are now able to link Google Classroom assignments directly to your TeacherPlus Gradebook!

### Release Notes and Overview Video

05-08-2020 - removed the release notes and overview video as Rediker made an interface tweak recently that does not match the notes from their suppport site.  As soon as corrected documentation is available I will post it here.

### How to Link Google Classroom to TeacherPlus Gradebook

- Allow **TeacherPlus Gradebook** to link with **Google Classroom**
  - Already done by APS IT Department - **no teacher interaction required.**
- Link a **TeacherPlus Gradebook** to a **Google Classroom**
  - Must be done one time for each class section you wish to link.
  - If the Google Classroom doesn’t already have students rostered - they receive an invite email.  If they are already rostered this isn’t necessary.
- Link a **TeacherPlus Gradebook assignment column** to a **Google Classroom assignment**
  - **IMPORTANT NOTE:** The Google Classroom assignment must have already been created prior to attempting to link.
  - When creating a new column in the TeacherPlus gradebook - check off “Add to PlusPortals as Coursework” and the assignment will appear in PlusPortals for parents to see.
- Retrieve assignment grades from **Google Classroom**
  - With one click, you pull in grades from Google Classroom for the assignment to your TeacherPlus Gradebook
  - **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Only assignments that have been graded and returned to students in Google Classroom will have their grades pulled in.
  - **IMPORTANT NOTE:** If a grade needs to be changed, it must be changed in Google Classroom and the grades must be re-pulled into TeacherPlus Gradebook.

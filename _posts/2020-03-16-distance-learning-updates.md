I wanted to share some updates from the Technology Department to help with the current situation and distance learning. 

We are encouraging all staff to utilize the resources we have in the district to help facilitate distance learning. This includes the use of Google Apps and Google Classroom. These are the most widely available and accessible tools in the district. Your school leaders will be providing additional resources through a Shared Google Drive called "Distance Learning." 

For students that do not have access to a device or the internet, the district will be providing options to parents and students. A separate email is going out to all students and parents with ways to request a device for home use and ways to get internet connection. 

For staff that require a device to use at home, please click the following link; [https://forms.gle/WxhALvKrapccM79X9](https://forms.gle/WxhALvKrapccM79X9)

We will be providing access to devices to the best of our abilities. The most common device we have available is the Chromebook. 

We have made Google Hangouts and Google Meet available for everyone with an @agawamed.org account. This will allow additional resources for teachers and students to interact and provide virtual classroom experiences. 

The Technology Support System will remain open through any school closures. If you have any questions or concerns, please send an email to [support@agawamed.org](mailto:support@agawamed.org) with technology related questions.

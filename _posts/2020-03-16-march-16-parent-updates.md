The Agawam Public Schoolsâ€™ teachers and staff are hard at work creating enrichment and review learning opportunities for our students during the school closure. We will provide a way to stay connected with education while away from school. We are utilizing technology resources when possible. 

We understand that not all students will have access to a device or internet. For students that need a school issued device or internet options, we ask them (or a parent) to please fill out the following form: [https://forms.gle/YTD1b569G4SwwmJU6](https://forms.gle/YTD1b569G4SwwmJU6)

If a student has a device already accessible to use at home, we ask that they use their personal device to access the resources. The district has a limited supply of devices to distribute where most needed.

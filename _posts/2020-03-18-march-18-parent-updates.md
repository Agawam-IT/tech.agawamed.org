**Device Pick Up** 

We will be holding a device pick up on Thursday, March 19th, from 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM at the Agawam High School. For parents and students that filled out the form, you will be able to pick up your device and resource sheet on internet connection. 

If you have not filled out the form yet, you still have until 5:00 PM on March 18, 2020. The form can be found at, [https://forms.gle/C31CiC81Y1euGLmz8](https://forms.gle/C31CiC81Y1euGLmz8). A physical copy of the form can be filled out at Agawam District Offices. 

If you are unable to make the device pick up time, other arrangements will be made based on the number of devices still needing to be distributed. 

**Software Resources**

Here is a list of the primary software we will be using to help provide distance learning opportunities. Individual teachers may have other software and resources available and will communicate that separately. 

Google Classroom - https://classroom.google.com 
Google Hangouts - https://hangouts.google.com 
Google Meet - https://meet.google.com 
Google Mail - https://mail.google.com 
PlusPortal - https://www.plusportals.com/AgawamHighSchool or through https://agawamed.org 

**Technology Help**

During this time of Distance Learning, we are opening up the districtâ€™s technology support line to students and parents that may be having issues with any school issued devices or software. You can submit a support ticket by emailing support@agawamed.org. Please provide as much detail as possible in the ticket and allow us time to respond. 

Thank you for working with us during these unprecedented times.

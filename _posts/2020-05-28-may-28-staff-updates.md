Here are a few updates from the Technology Department for May. We are in the home stretch of the school year. 

**Google Meet Grid View**

Google Meet had a recent update that allows grid view to be done natively. If you have the Grid View Extension installed on Chrome, please uninstall it. It will cause problems if you continue to use it. 

**Class and Parent Emails**

A reminder to all staff, if you are emailing directly a group of students/parents to use the Bcc functionality in Gmail. This will prevent parents from seeing each other's information and prevent replying to all mistakes.

**Device Collection**

The Technology Department is preparing for end of year device collection. Student device collection will happen the week of June 22nd - 26th. More information about drop off times and locations will be sent to parents. 

Staff device collection will happen, starting in July and running through the summer. This applies to devices that have been taken home during distance learning. All devices that remained in classrooms should be brought to your school's library before the last day of school. 

If you have any questions or concerns about anything in this announcement, please submit a support ticket.

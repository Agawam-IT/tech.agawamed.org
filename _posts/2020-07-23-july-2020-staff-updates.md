I hope everyone is having a great summer break. The Technology Department has a few updates to share for July. 

**New Content Filter**

We are currently testing a new content filter and firewall for the district. This will be replacing the Barracuda system that required staff and students to log in each time they accessed the internet. The new system will automatically log you in. 

Over the summer, if you are on a district device, you may notice sites being blocked that were not blocked in the past. We are still adjusting settings and filtering to prepare for the start of school. If you find a site is blocked, you may submit a support ticket to have it unblocked. 

**Software Purchasing**

There have been many meetings, surveys, and discussions in the district related to software to support learning this upcoming school year. Some decisions have been made, some are still being considered. We wanted to provide a list of what has been budgeted and/or purchased already. 

- Clever Single Sign On
- Accelerated Reader 
- Nearpod
- Screencastify
- Freckle ELA
- Freckle Math
- Star360
- GradeSlam
- BrainPop
- RazKids
- PebbleGo
- ESGI

The goal was to not remove any resources the district had in the previous school year, and add software that will assist with hybrid and remote learning. There are still several more software purchases that are being considered. If you have anything to add to the discussion, please contact the Technology and/or Curriculum Departments. 

**Device Purchasing** 

To support students this school year, the district will be going with a 1:1 program. Each student will have a device assigned to them for grades Pre-K to 12. The details are still being decided as equipment is being ordered. Here is the preliminary set up. 

- Pre-K will use iPads
- K-2 will use a combination of Chromebooks and Chrome Tablets
- 3-8 will use school issued Chromebooks
- 9-12 will have the option of a Chromebook or BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)

As stated before, these are the preliminary plans and are subject to change. As we get closer to the school year starting more information will be shared with staff, students, and parents. 

If you have any questions or concerns about anything in this announcement, please submit a support ticket.

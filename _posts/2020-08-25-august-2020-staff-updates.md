The start of school is just around the corner. Here are a few updates from the Technology Department to help with the start of school.

**Teacher Devices**

We will begin distributing teacher devices this week. Distribution will be done through drive up at AHS. Please follow the signs to the student parking lot entrance of the high school to pick up you device and drop off any devices or equipment you used during distance/summer learning. You will not leave your car, simply drive up and a member of the Technology Department will meet you. 

Distribution will be done in phases. 

Friday, August 28th, from 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM all classroom teachers from AHS will be able to pick up their device.

Monday, August 31st, from 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM all classrooms teachers from JHS, Doering, Clark, Robinson, Granger, and Phelps will be able to pick up their device. 

More dates will be sent out after the first round of distributions for additional staff.

If you have devices or equipment from distance and summer learning, please return these when you pick up your new devices. Anything used at home over the past several months will need to be set up and configured by the Technology Department for the upcoming school year. 

**Google Chat Migration**

The district has completed the migration to Google Chat. This is a replacement for Google Hangouts which is no longer supported by Google. 

This migration was only for chat/text services. It did not change anything with Google Meet. 

Students will not have access to Google Chat at this time. 

**Additional Software**

In our previous announcements, we shared some of the software that has been purchased over the summer. Adding to that list are:

- EdPuzzle
- SmartMusic
- Paper Education

**Single Sign On**

The Technology Department is still hard at work getting Single Sign On setup for all staff and students. We will notify all staff and students when the SSO Portal is ready for them. 

A special note for textbook accounts, please do not make change to your online textbook accounts over the next few weeks. We are in the process of migrating these to the SSO platform. 

**New Website**

Over the summer we have been working with website facilitators to build a new website and communication platform for the district. The new website will go live at the end of this month. 

If you have any questions or concerns about anything in this announcement, please submit a support ticket.

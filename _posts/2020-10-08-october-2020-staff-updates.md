Hello Agawam Public Schools,

The Technology Department has a few updates and announcements for everyone.

**Network Upgrades**

We are working on upgrades to the wireless network in the district. These upgrades will provide better support for the 1:1 device model we now have district wide.

Over the next month you may see networks titled; Staff, Student, and Guest. These are being set up and tested by the Technology Department. Please, do not try to connect to these networks until instructed to. They will not work.

**Clever Single Sign On**

The syncing issues with Rediker and Clever have been resolved. This was the roadblock preventing many of the software to be set up correctly. The Technology Department is working with our vendors to get all software on the Clever platform. More are being added everyday.

**Document Cameras**

The IPEVO Document Cameras arrived this week. We will be getting them ready and delivered to the schools for distribution soon.

These new document cameras will be assigned to individuals, not to the classroom. The same way the staff Chromebooks are assigned. The goal being, on days you need to work remotely, you can simply bring your document camera with you.

The software to work with the document cameras is being pushed out to devices today. You may see a few additional apps on your device next week.

**Chrome Extensions and Add-Ons**

There have been a few support tickets around this topic. Teachers and Staff are unrestricted from adding extensions to their devices. You are able to add and test out any free extension.

Students are only able to add extensions that have been approved for use. The extension must be unblocked by the Technology Department. If you need an extension approved for your students, please send a support ticket and include a link to the extension.

At this time we are not able to approve extensions that access student data. If an extension requires the student to create an account or costs money, then the extension will need to go through the usual software purchasing process with the Technology and Curriculum Departments.

If you have any questions or concerns about anything in this announcement, please submit a support ticket.

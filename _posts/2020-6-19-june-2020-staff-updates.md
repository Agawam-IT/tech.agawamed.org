Today is the last day of school, and the end to a school year we will not soon forget. Much of what happened this school year will have an impact on our district for years to come. The Technology Department has a few updates for June, as we wrap up this school year and prepare for next school year. 

**Student Device Collection**

Student device collection will be happening June 22nd - 26th at Agawam High Schools. A schedule has already been sent to all parents and students. We would like to make staff aware of it as well: 

- June 22nd from 9:00 - 1:00 Clark and Phelps Students
- June 23rd from 9:00 - 1:00 Agawam High School Students
- June 24th from 9:00 - 1:00 Junior High and Robinson Students
- June 25th from 9:00 - 1:00 Granger and Doering Students
- June 26th from 10:00 - 2:00 Make up day for all schools 

Students are requested to bring their device and charger to Agawam High School. There will be signs to direct the cars. The devices will be dropped off without leaving the car. Additional collection days may be offered during the summer if needed. 

**Staff Device Collection**

No dates have been set for staff device collection at this time. All staff are asked to hold onto their device at this time and monitor their email for future announcements. If you have a device and you do not want to have it at home, you may email support@agawamed.org to arrange a drop off time. 

We are aware that many teachers will need devices over the summer for various reasons. We are working to accommodate everyone as best as possible. If you do not have a device, but will need one for the summer, please contact the support desk. 

**District Wide Software**

Distance Learning has introduced lots of new software to the district. The Technology Department and Curriculum Department have been working to evaluate this software and find a plan to keep the best software for next school year. This will include buying district and school wide licenses when necessary. 

As part of this process the Technology Department is developing a Single Sign On solution for use in the upcoming school year. This will greatly reduce the number of logins students and staff need to use. It will also allow us to keep all of our software under one system. More on this system as we get closer to the start of school. 

If you have any questions or concerns about anything in this announcement, please submit a support ticket.

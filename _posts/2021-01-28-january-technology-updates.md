The Technology Department has a few updates and reminders for everyone. Last we updated everyone was just before Thanksgiving. We hope everyone had a good December break, and excited about 2021. 

**Portable Displays**

A reminder to all staff that we have portable displays that work with staff Chromebooks. These are a great way to add a second screen to your Chromebooks that will work in the classroom and when remote. If you have an Asus Staff Chromebook and want a display, simply request one through the support desk. 

**Document Cameras**

 Our latest order of document cameras arrived in early January. Anyone that had requested one, and was on the waiting list should have received theirs. If you are still in need of a document camera, please send in a support ticket. 

**Support Desk Updates**

The Technology Department has been working non-stop to answer support tickets as quickly and efficiently as possible. Our total ticket count is now below 300. This is down from our high of over 2000 earlier in the school year. 

If you need help from the technology department, we ask that you please submit the ticket for yourself. We ask that you do not submit a ticket on behalf of someone else. Often times, the Technology Department will need to ask follow up questions directly to the person having the issue. Thank you for helping us keep thing organized. 

If you have a support ticket open, and are not receiving a resolution fast enough, please reach out to your building principal or administrator. They will bring the issue directly to Stephen Woicik. 

**Network Drive Migration**

Back in February of 2020, we began letting everyone know about our migration away from Network Drives. We want to make this transition as easy as possible and provide plenty of time for the migration.

Network Drives are Windows computer drives that store data on a central server, not on the computer. These are typically called F: Drive or H: Drive in the district. We will be migrating from a local server network drive to a cloud based drive on G Suite and Google Drive. 

If you are using a Chromebook for your work, nothing will be changing. Chromebooks only have access to Google Drive. 

The Technology Department is still planning to shut down Network Drives at the end of the 2020-2021 school year.  We encourage everyone to use Google File Stream and Google Drive. A good rule of thumb is...

> If you can access the file on your Chromebook, the file is saved in the right place. 

If you need help or further explanation, please submit a support request to the Technology Department. Anyone on the staff will be able to get you set up with Google File Stream and start moving files over. There is also a helpful document on Google File Stream.

**Chromebook Updates**

One last reminder, please restart your Chromebooks devices when you have time. This allows for critical updates and patches to be installed. Simply closing the lid of your Chromebook does not power it off.

If you have any questions or concerns about any of these updates, please submit a support ticket.
